- Break a block and get a random item instead!
- Items can be enchanted randomly with configurable chances.
- Occasionally, find enchanted books with random enchantments.
- Fully configurable via `config.yml`.
- Easily exclude unwanted items from random drops.
- Player-friendly messages with color support.
